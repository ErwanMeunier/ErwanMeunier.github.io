Abstract: First we show that state-of-the-art upper-bounds on the Static Regret are not tight. Then, we give a Burer-Monteiro
non-convex PEP formulation returning the lowest dimensional exact worst-case instance for OGD and we demonstrate experimentally that it is often in 2 dimensions. Finally, under some mild assumptions and given a fixed step-size strategy, we propose an analytical formula to build a worst-case instance with $f_t$ being piecewise-linear and giving the associated tight worst-case bound for OGD.

I am Erwan Meunier, a PhD student at UCLouvain in the ICTEAM institute. My research focuses on online optimization, decentralized optimization and the Performance Estimation Problems framework, aiming to assess the performance of cutting-edge optimization algorithms. I also have a strong background and keen interest in Combinatorial Optimization and Operations Research in general. In addition, I am actively involved in and supportive of the open-source community.
